# ifthenfund_states

We want to create an open source, easily replicable pop-up site for petitions with teeth - in other words, it includes a donation - for state legislators. Petitions that send a message - IF you support X bill, THEN I will fund your campaign.  Money gets access and attention, and in politics, we recognize that this MATTERS. Individuals rarely get into that game except around high profile bills that excite passion. We want to empower individuals and small donors to have a stronger collective voice when those bills arise.

Inspired by similar idea being prototyped at federal level: https://github.com/if-then-fund/if.then.fund

User story: I am pissed about a stupid bill that was passed and i want tor reward the politicians who voted NO. I tweet about it with a hashtag in solidarity to create buzz, but it's probably just noise. I want a quick way to donate a dollar or two to every person who voted No (or Yes) so the politician gets my email, note (tweet?), donation and sees me as someone who has more skin in the game. Hopefully this empowers and emboldens them to act in our interests.

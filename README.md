# ifthenfund_states

We want to create an open source, easily replicable pop-up site for petitions with teeth - in other words, it includes a donation - for state legislators.

User story: I am pissed about a stupid bill that was passed and i want tor reward the politicians who voted NO. I tweet about it with a hashtag in solidarity to create buzz, but it's probably just noise. I want a quick way to donate a dollar or two to every person who voted No (or Yes) so the politician gets my email, note (tweet?), donation and sees me as someone who has more skin in the game. Hopefully this empowers and emboldens them to act in our interests. Money gets access and attention, and in politics, we recognize that. We want to empower individuals and small donors to have a larger collective voice.

Inspired by similar idea being prototyped at federal level: https://github.com/if-then-fund/if.then.fund
